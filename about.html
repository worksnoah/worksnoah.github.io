            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I'm Noah Rolf Levy, a high school student from Miami, Florida, with a strong interest in engineering and design. I've built my own 3D printer with advanced capabilities, designed and manufactured custom products for Tempus Redux, a startup I co-founded, and created the Levy Additive Manufacturing Corner to offer free 3D printing resources at my school.

I enjoy working with different 3D printing technologies and materials, using my skills in CAD and electronics to bring new ideas to life. I'm always looking for the next project to push the boundaries of what's possible with technology.I’m dedicated to pushing the boundaries of mechanical engineering and 3D printing. My work includes designing custom 3D printers, developing projects with microcontrollers, and creating detailed CAD designs. Each project is a chance to explore new ideas and share them with the community. Feel free to dive into the projects, offer feedback, or contribute if you’re interested!</p>
