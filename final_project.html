                <strong>Market Research and News. (2024). Rugged Portable Computer Market [2024-2031] Size, Analysis, and Outlook Insights.</strong> The rugged portable computer market was valued at 2.1 billion USD as of 2023 and is expected to be worth 3.1 billion by 2035. In particular, it identifies North America as a major growth region because of the various technological advancements and computing manufacturing giants located here. Panasonic, Dell, Getac, and Durabook are also recognized as the industry leaders. The idea of a rugged portable computer has grown thanks to an increase in applications, like military/defense, industrial, and public safety. This article validates the demand for a rugged portable computer by showing that a market already exists and that it will continue to grow in the coming years. Additionally, it names companies that currently make products like our own, which provides us with a point of comparison for our design. However, because the market is already dominated by these companies, it could pose a challenge for new entrants. Additionally, it doesn’t mention our use case, maritime safety. Finally, the article doesn’t provide any specifics as to what the most popular kinds of rugged portable computers are, like handhelds or laptops.

                <strong>Blickenstorfer, C. H. (2024). Case study: Computers in marine exploration - Handheld Algiz RT10 rugged Android tablet computer boosts productivity, data capture and positioning on all-female marine expedition beyond the Arctic Circle. RuggedPCReview.com.</strong> This article is about an expedition to Norway’s Arctic fjords in which a rugged computing device was used. The device in question was an Android tablet that was chosen because it was capable of withstanding the extreme cold and wetness of the arctic environment. They used it to capture data, photos, and videos, and compute marine data. If the computer hadn’t been designed to withstand harsh conditions, they wouldn’t have been able to document their data on the expedition. This article validates our use case for the cyberdeck and provides an example of how useful it can be. Recording data is an important task that wouldn’t have been possible without the rugged computing device. Despite only focusing on one use case, this article validates the portability, durability, and resilience of a device like ours. The article was about a tablet, not a laptop, which has more mechanical parts, like hinges and keyboards, which can be damaged in a temperature extreme environment. Additionally, a tablet has a longer battery life, which is an issue we will have to overcome in our design when making the computer.

                <strong>Business Research Insights. (n.d.). Rugged laptop computer market research report: Global forecast till 2031.</strong> This report is a combination of an analysis of the market, as well as a description of what a rugged portable computer is and what it can do. These devices combine the functionality of a laptop and a tablet while reinforcing the resistance to elements. They are constructed using a tough plastic casing, which is tested to withstand drops, shocks, extreme temperatures, dust, and water penetration. This is done by extending the battery life, isolating important components, and reinforcing the internal structure. It underscores the importance of having a rugged laptop in an extreme environment, or in a sector where reliability is key. This analysis provides more insights into the rugged laptop sector and validates the demand for such a product. It also mentions the opportunities and setbacks that occurred during the pandemic, which provides more context for where the device could be used. Additionally, it mentions certain features that are common in these devices, which could help us implement them. Furthermore, it highlights that rugged computers are expensive, mainly due to their specially designed construction and extreme testing, which provides us with an opportunity to create a budget portable computer. However, the article refers not just to laptops, but to handhelds, like tablets, which could lead us to pursue the wrong market.
