            <h2>Solution Overview</h2>
            <p>In this phase of the project, the objective is to design a solution that addresses the critical issues faced by vessels operating in remote areas without internet connectivity. The proposed solution is a ruggedized, portable device that provides GPS and essential offline resources to aid in navigation and emergency situations.</p>
