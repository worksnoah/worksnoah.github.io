            <h2>Solution Overview</h2>
            <p>In this phase of the project, the objective is to design a solution that addresses the critical issues faced by vessels operating in remote areas without internet connectivity. The proposed solution is a ruggedized, portable device that provides GPS and essential offline resources to aid in navigation and emergency situations.</p>

          <div class="daily-update" id="day-1">
              <h3>Day 1: Initial Components Arrive</h3>
              <img src="images/IMG_0190.jpg" alt="Box of components including power bank and HDMI cable" class="update-image">
              <p>Today, the Raspberry Pi 5, 72000mAh power bank, and HDMI cables came in. We laid them out in the case to get a feel for how much space they would take up.</p>
          </div>

          <!-- Day 2 -->
          <div class="daily-update" id="day-2">
              <h3>Day 2: Portable HDMI Monitor Delivered</h3>
              <img src="images/IMG_0189.jpg" alt="Box containing a portable 10.1-inch HDMI monitor" class="update-image">
              <p>The 10.1-inch HDMI monitor arrived today. We connected it to the Raspberry Pi, and it worked perfectly. It’s small enough to fit well in the case but still large enough to be practical for tasks.</p>
          </div>

          <!-- Day 3 -->
          <div class="daily-update" id="day-3">
              <h3>Day 3: High-Capacity Power Supply Unboxing</h3>
              <img src="images/IMG_0188.jpg" alt="EnergyQC 72000mAh power bank in packaging" class="update-image">
              <p>We tested how the power bank fits in the case today. It’s a bit bigger and heavier than we expected, but it will still work. It definitely adds some weight to the setup, but the rugged case should handle it.</p>
          </div>

          <!-- Day 4 -->
          <div class="daily-update" id="day-4">
              <h3>Day 4: Rugged Case Received</h3>
              <img src="images/IMG_0186.jpg" alt="Open rugged case with foam padding" class="update-image">
              <p>The rugged case came in today. It’s tough and has foam padding to keep everything secure. We spent some time testing different layouts to figure out the best way to organize the components inside.</p>
          </div>

          <!-- Day 5 -->
          <div class="daily-update" id="day-5">
              <h3>Day 5: Fully Assembled Rugged Case</h3>
              <img src="images/IMG_0185.jpg" alt="Fully assembled rugged green case" class="update-image">
              <p>Today, we debated on which case we should use. They are both equally rigid, but we decided to use the bigger case because the depth will give us more room for batteries and other components. Next time, we will determine the layout of all the parts.</p>

            <h3>Day 6: Battery Completion</h3>
            <img src="images/battery.jpeg" alt="Fully assembled rugged green case" class="update-image">
            <p>Today, Marcus did an amazing job of wiring up the battery to give us a circuit that runs in parallel with a total of 77,000mAh capacity!</p>

            <h3>Day 8: CAD Day!</h3>
            <p>Today, we finally began the CAD for the main case assembly. We will be dividing up the components based on the complexity of the separate parts and our own individual modeling abilities.</p>

            <h3>Day 9: CAD for Personal Project</h3>
            <p>Today I took some time to work on the CAD for my personal project, a portable 3D-Printer that fits inside a Pelican case and can be ready to go in under a minute </p>

            <h3>Day 10: Insufficient Battery Output</h3>
            <img src="images/battery.jpeg" alt="Fully assembled rugged green case" class="update-image">
            <p>Today we diagnosed the issue where we weren't getting enough power from the battery to turn on the Pi or the screen. I think it is because the USB-C cable has weak connections to the boards omn both ends. </p>

        <div class="daily-update" id="day-11">
            <h3>Day 11: Fixing the Weak Battery Output</h3>
            <img src="images/battery.jpeg" alt="Fully assembled rugged green case" class="update-image">
            <p>We discovered that a poorly wired USB-C cable was causing a loss in voltage. I solved this by wiring the voltage boost PCB to a USB-C breakout board. </p>
