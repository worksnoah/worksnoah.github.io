            In this simple circuit, I control an LED's on/off state with minimal components. I designed it to demonstrate the basics of LED operation, focusing on how current flows to produce light. It's a straightforward setup, perfect for showcasing fundamental electronics principles.

            This circuit also controls an LED, but I added a switch to easily toggle the light on and off. I kept the design simple to focus on how components like switches interact with LEDs, making it ideal for beginners learning about basic electrical circuits.
